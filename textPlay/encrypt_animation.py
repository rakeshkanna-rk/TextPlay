    Simulate the encryption process by displaying random special characters before revealing the actual word.

    Parameters:
    word (str): The word to be displayed.
    sleep_time (float): The time in seconds to wait before showing the next set of random characters. Default is 0.1.
    end_color (str): The ANSI escape code for the color to be applied to the final word display. Default is BLUE.
    special_characters (str): The set of special characters to randomly choose from during the simulation. Default is "!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?/".

    >>> encrypted("Hello", sleep_time=0.1, end_color=BLUE)
